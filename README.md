# Worpress 3.5.1 Bangla book
---
The Book will be written by some Good People in Collaborative Effort.


## Idea and work-flow
We will write a good book on wordpress together, in Bangla, to help the developers and enthusiasts start their journey in developing beatiful themes, plugins and applications completely using wordpress

To keep the flow and tone of writing equally pleasing through out the book, we will have audio files narated by one person. These audio files will be distrbuted in smaller chunks - for example each sections will have their own audio file grouped together as a chapter. Once these audio files are available to everyone, the contributors will download and compose in native bangla text.

Afer the text files in bangla are written, a group of developers will add the example source code. 

## Bundling
After the source code are attached and embedded in each chapter, we will send these files to proof readers. After correction, spell checking and fixing minor faults, these files will be sent for page layout.


The page layout group will generate the final pdf files for each of these chapters. After preparing the pdf files for all these chapters, we will bundle them together as a digital book.

##Distribution
 The bundled digital book will be distributed under `CC-BY-NC-ND` (Creative Commons Non Commercial, No Derivative) License to make it available for free.
